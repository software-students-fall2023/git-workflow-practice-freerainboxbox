It's ironic that I'm posting about this particular article on GitHub, a Microsoft brand. Ever since 2018, the sheer scope of GitHub has expanded from hosting many important projects ([including Git itself](https://github.com/git/git)) to [storing code in the Arctic](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) and [stealing traffic](https://blog.techmaxima.in/the-impact-of-chatgpt-and-github-copilot-on-stack-overflow-traffic/) from Stack Overflow.

We make use of a lot of Microsoft services and code, and sometimes we aren't aware of it. The convenience we get from it early on does have some implications, however, and Microsoft isn't the only company to do this. Any big name tech giant has been accused of locking features exclusive to their platforms, and it seems like this is only going to get worse. Media formats are a great example of this. Google opposed the inclusion of the highest-performing image codec, JPEG XL, because it caused issues with their rival codec, AVIF (a subset of AV1, which just so happens to be [finally supported by Apple](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1694598394) after a long delay, who is part of a patent pool for an older codec). This thereby embraces AVIF, extends its support on browsers, and extinguishes competition. You've probably heard the meme about having to screenshot anything with the `.webp` extension because your OS doesn't support it. The same thing is happening all over again.

Amazon does the same thing with AWS. So many new features and cost savings can be had from going serverless, and Amazon offers perhaps the most feature-complete offering. That leaves little room for competitors. It's a bit strange that Netflix, a direct competitor to Amazon, is also one of its biggest customers.

At the end of all of it, who gets the short end of the stick? Software engineers and end users.
